djangular
=========

A reusable app that provides better app integration with Angular. Djangular
allows you to create Angular content per app, instead of creating a single
massive Angular application inside of Django. This allows you to selectively use
apps per site, as well as create a consistent structure across all of your
Django apps.

This is intended to be a Django version of the Angular-Seed project
(https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). The current mindset is to limit the
amount of changes introduced by Djangular.


Requirements
------------

+ Currently requires Python 2.7.
+ Requires Django 1.4 or 1.5.
+ Local installs of Node.js and Karma for testing.


Installation
------------

+ You may install directly from pypi:

        pip install djangular

+ Or download the source and install it in a terminal/console:

        python setup.py install

+ Or download the source and move the djangular directory inside your django
  project as an app.


Configuration Changes Needed for Djangular
------------------------------------------

+ Djangular needs to be placed as an app inside a Django project and added to
  the INSTALLED_APPS setting. Also, the staticfiles contrib library will need to
  be included if it isn't.

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'djangular',
            ...
        )

+ After you install Djangular inside a project, you will need to run the
  `makeangularsite` command to properly setup Karma into your default site
  directory. Note: You may need to edit these configuration templates to add any
  additional javascript libraries.

        python manage.py makeangularsite

+ The STATICFILES_FINDERS needs to be updated to include
`djangular.finders.NamespacedAngularAppDirectoriesFinder`.

        STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
            'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
            'djangular.finders.NamespacedAngularAppDirectoriesFinder'
        )

+ Because of this new finder, the `findstatic` and `collectstatic` commands will
  place the angular files underneath an `<app_name>/` folder. You will not need
  to namespace each of your static directories (unless you really want to).

+ To create an app already setup with the djangular (angular-seed) structure,
  run `python manage.py startangularapp <app_name>` from the command line. This
  will create the files and directory structures needed for you to get started.

+ To use the Angular module that Djangular provides you, you'll need to add the
  djangular app to your projects URLs.

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            ...
            url(r'^djangular/', include('djangular.urls')),
            ...
        )

+ Djangular also includes a JSON Vulnerability middleware that AngularJS knows
  how to process. To include this protection, add
  `djangular.middleware.AngularJsonVulnerabilityMiddleware` to the
  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting. This only affects JSON requests (based on
  Content-Type), so this can be located fairly low in the middleware stack.

        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
            ...
            'djangular.middleware.AngularJsonVulnerabilityMiddleware'
        )


Comparison between Djangular and Angular-Seed
---------------------------------------------

+ Each app has its own Angular "app" folder, with directories for CSS, JS,
  images and partials supplied. As a result, the URLs for these get grouped into
  the STATIC_URL structure of Django. So, each resource inside an Angular app
  will have a `{{ STATIC URL }}/{{ app_name }}/` prefix.
    * Note: Because of these URLs, referring to Angular content in a separate
      app should use a `../<separate_app>/` URL. This will help significantly
      during testing to make sure paths are correct.
    * Note: It is recommended to namespace the Angular code the same name as the
      Django app. The created JS files do this already.

+ Tests have moved from `test/` to `tests/`. There are `unit/` and `e2e/`
subdirectories where the Angular tests go.

+ The `lib/` directory (containing the AngularJS code) has been moved to the
  static folder of the Djangular app. This will use the normal Django static
  urls: `{{ STATIC URL }}/lib/angular/angular.js`

+ The `config/` directory is now placed inside of your default Django site. Each
  individual Django app doesn't need its own AngularJS or Karma config.

+ The `scripts/` directory has removed, because the Angular-Seed scripts have
  been made into Django commands. These commands exist in the standard
  `management/` directory.
    * `makeangularsite` places the Karma configuration templates inside the
      given Django Site directory. This should be run after installing
      Djangular.
    * `runtestserver` runs a local Django Web Server configured to support
      running all e2e tests.
    * `startangularapp` creates a Django app with the Angular structure.
    * `testjs` runs the Karma Server for either the unit or e2e tests. Note that
      the e2e tests requires the `runtestserver` to be running beforehand.


How to obtain the Django Template variables into Angular
--------------------------------------------------------

There is an Angular module called `djangular` that is rendered via the Django
templating engine to obtain common template variables like the `STATIC_URL`,
`MEDIA_URL`, the User object, etc. This app includes a service called
`DjangoProperties`, which will enable you to get access to those variables, and
a `django` filter, which follows the standard Angular filtering rules. The URL
for this JavaScript is `/djangular/app.js` (Note that is not static).


Current Roadmap
---------------

+ Auto-detection of node and karma installs.
+ Providing additional synchronization between Django models and Angular's
  $resource. This includes removing the patch for Angular's $resource, yet not
  having to require Django's `FORCE_SLASHES` setting to be False.
+ Using Django's ModelForms and Templates to provide an easy way to generate
  Angular partials.
